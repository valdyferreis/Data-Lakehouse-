    "\n",
    "  - **Landing layer:** This step involves extracting data from the OLTP database in RDS and from the streaming service's S3 bucket and storing the raw data in the `landing_zone`.\n",
    "    - RDS Landing: An AWS Glue Job is used to connect to the RDS database and retrieve the data in CSV format. \n",
    "    - Streaming Landing: An AWS Glue Job is used to ingest the data from the `source_bucket` in S3, which is stored in JSON format. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Curated layer:** After extracting the data, Glue jobs will perform data transformation on top of the raw data. In addition to the transformation, the new curated sources will be stored in the `curated_zone` and added to the Glue Catalog.\n",
    "    -  CSV Transformation: For the RDS tables, they will be enriched with metadata, the schema will be enforced and then the data will be stored in parquet format. \n",
    "    -  JSON Transformation: While the streaming data, as the JSON data containing ratings,  will be joined with the data from the OLTP system to create a table to be used for the ML team. This data will be stored as an Apache Iceberg table. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Presentation layer:** [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/en/athena/), a serverless, interactive analytics service, is used to query the data stored in the `curated_zone` using the Glue Catalog. It enables SQL-like queries without needing to extract the data from S3 and load it into a traditional database. You will create presentation tables in this layer to solve some of the reporting and analytical needs using SQL queries, storing the data in Apache Iceberg format in the `presentation_zone`.\n",

It's designed to provide fast, consistent, and reliable access to large datasets in cloud storage. Under the hood, Iceberg leverages a combination of file formats, metadata management, and transactional capabilities to provide efficient access to large datasets. It typically stores data using columnar file formats such as Parquet or ORC. These formats are optimized for analytical queries. On the other hand, Iceberg maintains extensive metadata alongside the actual data files. This metadata includes information about the table schema, partitioning strategy, file locations, and transaction state. By storing metadata separately from the data files, Iceberg ensures efficient management and access to table metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main features of the Apache Iceberg format are:\n",
    "- **Schema Flexibility**: Iceberg facilitates schema evolution, enabling the addition or removal of table columns without necessitating a full dataset rewrite. This ensures seamless backward compatibility as data structures evolve over time.\n",
    "- **Transactional Integrity**: Iceberg tables ensure atomic commits, guaranteeing that all table changes are transactional. This ensures that updates are either fully executed or entirely rolled back, maintaining data consistency and reliability.\n",
    "- **Data Partitioning**: Iceberg supports data partitioning based on one or more columns, enhancing query performance by minimizing data scan volumes. Particularly beneficial for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Metadata Management**: Iceberg maintains comprehensive metadata alongside the data, including schema details, partitioning specifications, and file locations. This metadata is stored separately from the data files, simplifying management and queries."

The data is hosted in the same bucket, but at the S3 key named `ratings_with_timestamp`. This will be the folder where all new data will continue to be stored. Your task is to add the new column to your `ratings` table at the `curated_zone` database and then extract the new data.
